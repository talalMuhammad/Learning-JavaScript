DOM

* The document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for manipulating HTML and XML documents. (add, remove, and modify parts of the document / HTML)

* with the object model, javaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:
    * javascript can change all the HTML elements in the page
    * javascript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
    * javaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
    * javaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes 
    * javaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
    * javaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
    * javaScript can create new HTML events in the Page

* Note: in the DOM, all HTMLelements are defined as objects. So it will have both property and method

* The document object represents your web page

* if you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object
