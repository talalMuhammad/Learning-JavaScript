Don't repeat Your Self

How we will proceed

1. Understand Object Oriented concept in real life.

    * Three Important words to understand 
        1. Object
            * in this world every thing is a object (living things and non living things)

            * Example "Ahmed" (man), Honda city (car) 

            * Every Object has 2 things:
                1. features or Properties
                2. Actions performed by or performed on it

            * Ahmed (Man)
                1. features or Properties: fullName, Height, Weight, Age
                2. Action: walk, eat, sleep

            * Honda City (car)
                1. features or properties: name, color, model, brand
                2. actions: drive, repair, fuel filling

            * abhi for example hamery pas 3 log hen 

                1 Ahmed 
                    1. features or Properties: fullName, Height, Weight, Age
                    2. Action: walk, eat, sleep 

                2 Jeff Bezos 
                    1. features or Properties: fullName, Height, Weight, Age
                    2. Action: walk, eat, sleep 

                3 Elon Musk
                    1. features or Properties: fullName, Height, Weight, Age
                    2. Action: walk, eat, sleep 

            * ab agar hm dakhen to Ahmed jeff and elon 3no me 1 jesy hi properties aur action hen like 3no ka name he height he weight he age he 3no walk kar sakty hen eat kar sakty hen sleep kar sakty hen. 
            value change ho sakti he ky kon kitni walk kar sakta he ya kis ka weight kitna he ya kis ki age kitni he 
            overAll dakha jaye to 3no ky features or Actions same hi hen to
            agar dakha jaye to agar hm 3no ko alag alag likhen gy to hm 1 hi kam repeat kar rahy hen to  
            hm in 3no ko 1 common name day sakty hen jesy ky Man

            * ab yahan sy shuru hota he class ka consept

        2. Class

        * to Ab hm ny Man name ki class bana di ky jo bhi Man ho ga us ky pass ye ye features hon gy or on pe ye ye actions hm kar sakty hen 
            Ahmed (Man)
            Jeff Bezos (Man)
            Elon Musk (Man)

        * ab jb bhi koi boly ga Man ap ko pta hoga ky agar Man he to us ka name hoga height bhi kuch hogi etc
            
        * so Class is Groping of Object
            Ahmed (Man) - Ahmed is a object of Man class
            jeff (Man) - jeff is a object of Man class
            elon (Man) - elon is a object of Man class

        * ab for example hamary pass 1 or class he software enginer ki or us ky features and action hen
            1. features or properties: experience, experise, companyName, companyId
            2. Actions: code, test debug, deploy

        * ab for example Ahmed class Man me bhi he or Class software me bhi he to 
            agar dakha jaye to software class wali Properties zaruri nhi he ky man class me bhi ho leken leken leken man class wali properties software class me bhi hongi for example animals to codeing nhi kar sakty hen birds ðŸ¦… ki to company ki id nhi hogi na 

        * to Man class wali properties hamen software class ko bhi dani pary gi 
            to kiya ab sb ky liye alag alag phir sy hm likhen gy ky software me ab height bhi add karo Ahmed sahab aye hen to man lo jeff bhi software wali class me ajata he to us ky liye bhi alag sy likhna pary ga ky jeff ki age kitni he height kitni he 

        * to yahan concept ata he Inheritance ka

        3. Inheritance

2. understand Object Oriented concept in Programming (Procedural vs object oriented)

3. Four pillar of Object Oriented Programming (Important for Interview)

    * Encapsulation
    * Abstraction
    * Inheritance
    * Polymorphism

4. Old Object Oriented programming in javaScript till ES5

5. new Class feature in ES6
